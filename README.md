# UniAlgo
- This library is a personal project developed to explore and familiarize myself with various features of the C++ programming language. It contains code on concepts, topics, and algorithms that I wanted to delve deep into. The code will not necessarily be well-optimized.

## Contributing
I'm happy to receive and actively encourage code reviews. Constructive feedback not only improves the quality of the code but also provides an excellent opportunity to learn and enhance our understanding of C++ best practices. Feel free to share your insights, suggestions, and recommendations. 

This is the first official project where I use CMake. Help and suggestions are more than welcomed!
